# React + Vite
# Welcome to Meet App

## Objective:

To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

## Meet Project Features and Scenarios:


## Feature: Show/Hide Event Details

As a user, I should be able to show or hide event details, so that I can easily access or minimize event information as needed.

  Scenario: Event element is collapsed by default
    Given the user is on the events page
    Then the event element should be collapsed by default

  Scenario: User can expand an event to see details
    Given the user is on the events page
    When the user clicks on an event
    Then the event details should be expanded

  Scenario: User can collapse an event to hide details
    Given the user has expanded an event to see details
    When the user clicks on the event again
    Then the event details should be collapsed



## Feature: Specify Number of Events

As a user, I should be able to specify the number of events displayed, so that I can control how many events I see at once and manage my event list more efficiently.

  Scenario: Default number of events displayed
    Given the user is on the events page
    When the user has not specified a number of events
    Then 32 events should be shown by default

  Scenario: User changes the number of events displayed
    Given the user is on the events page
    When the user specifies a number of events to display
    Then the specified number of events should be shown


## Feature: Use the App When Offline

As a user, I should be able to use the app when offline, so that I can access important features and information even without an internet connection.

  Scenario: Show cached data when thereâ€™s no internet connection
    Given the user is on the events page
    And there is no internet connection
    Then the app should show cached data

  Scenario: Show error when user changes search settings
    Given the user is on the events page
    And there is no internet connection
    When the user changes the search settings (city, number of events)
    Then the app should show an error message


## Feature: Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen

As a user, I should be able to add an app shortcut to the home screen, so that I can quickly and conveniently access the app directly from my home screen without navigating through menus.

  Scenario: User can install the meet app as a shortcut on their device home screen
    Given the user is on the meet app page
    When the user opts to install the app as a shortcut
    Then the app should provide an option to add the shortcut to the device home screen
    And the shortcut should be added to the user's home screen


## Feature: Display Charts Visualizing Event Details

As a user, I should be able to view charts visualizing event details, so that I can easily understand and analyze event data through visual representations.

  Scenario: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
    Given the user is on the events page
    When the user views event details
    Then the app should display a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
